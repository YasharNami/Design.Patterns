# C# Design Patterns

# What are Design Patterns ?
Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development.<br />
Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.

The 23 Gang of Four (GoF) patterns are generally considered the foundation for all other patterns.<br />
They are categorized in three groups: 


Category  | Description
------------- | -------------
Creational  | As the name suggests, it provides the object or classes creation mechanism that enhance the flexibilities and reusability of the existing code. They reduce the dependency and controlling how the use interaction with our class so we wouldn't deal with the complex construction.
Structural  | Structural Design Patterns mainly responsible for assemble object and classes into a larger structure making sure that these structure should be flexible and efficient. They are very essential for enhancing readability and maintainability of the code. It also ensure that functionalities are properly separated, encapsulated. It reduces the minimal interface between interdependent things.
Behavioral  | Behavior Design Patterns are responsible for how one class communicates with others.



This repo provides source code for each of the 23 GoF patterns.
